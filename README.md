D&D&U

Dungeons and Dragons today isn’t your parents’ RPG. Celebrating its 45th anniversary this year, D&D’s popularity and visibility continue to grow, as does its potential user base. However, this increased visibility comes with potential new players who are scared off by the perceived barrier to entry - specifically, building their first character, which can be intimidating when you’re faced with a blank character sheet. D&D&U is here to streamline that process: users can build out a character’s stats, race, class, and alignment, ensuring they don’t forget a vital part of character creation, and tracking their current character build along the way. D&D&U is the quickest way to get off of the paper and onto your next adventure.
